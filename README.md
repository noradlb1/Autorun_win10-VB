Autorun_win10-VB

Makes Autorun.inf files run automatically when an SD card or USB thumbdrive is inserted into a computer. Works on Windows XP, 7, 8 and 10.

Requires .NET Framework 4.5 - https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=30653

How It Works
Checks for a new removable device inserted for an Autorun.inf file. Then checks the Autorun.inf file for an open= or ShellExecute= and runs the executable.
